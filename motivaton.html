    <h1>Inspiring Stories for Future Achievers</h1>

    <div class="story">
      <h2>Swami Vivekananda</h2>
      <p>
        Born as Narendranath Datta in 1863, Swami Vivekananda faced intense inner conflict and existential questions from a young age. Searching for spiritual answers, he met his guru Sri Ramakrishna, who transformed his life. Despite personal loss, poverty, and periods of doubt, he emerged as one of India‚Äôs greatest spiritual leaders.
        <br><br>
        In 1893, at the Parliament of the World's Religions in Chicago, he began his speech with ‚ÄúSisters and Brothers of America,‚Äù which was met with a standing ovation. He emphasized the unity of all religions, the strength of Indian spirituality, and the importance of service to mankind. His teachings inspired millions to awaken the power within.
        <br><br>
        His life teaches us that confidence, spiritual focus, and service to others are the cornerstones of greatness. His most famous quote still echoes in classrooms across India: <strong>"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached."</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story">
      <h2>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam</h2>
       <p>
        Born into a modest family in Rameswaram in 1931, Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam rose through sheer hard work and discipline. As a newspaper delivery boy, he funded his studies and developed a love for learning. He joined DRDO and later ISRO, where he played a pivotal role in India‚Äôs first satellite launch and missile programs.
        <br><br>
        He was the Chief Architect of India‚Äôs nuclear tests at Pokhran and earned the title "Missile Man of India." Despite his achievements, he remained humble, accessible, and deeply committed to the youth of the country. As President, he inspired a generation by writing books like *Wings of Fire* and *Ignited Minds*.
        <br><br>
        His story reminds us that no matter where you start, you can rise to greatness with curiosity, dedication, and a heart full of dreams. He famously said: <strong>"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</strong>
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="story">
      <h2>Dr. Vikram Sarabhai</h2>
      <p>
        A visionary scientist born in 1919, Vikram Sarabhai founded ISRO and laid the foundation for India's space research. At a time when India had limited resources, he believed in using science for development. He once said, <strong>"We do not have the fantasy of competing with the economically advanced nations in the exploration of the moon or the planets or manned space-flight."</strong>
        <br><br>
        Instead, he wanted satellites to help with education, weather forecasting, and national development. He established institutions like IIM Ahmedabad and the Physical Research Laboratory. His leadership brought global respect to India‚Äôs scientific community.
        <br><br>
        Sarabhai teaches us that leadership is about vision, service, and creating institutions that outlive you. His courage to dream big helped launch India into the space age.

      <h2>A Special Message to Every JEE Aspirant</h2>
      <p>
        To you ‚Äî the student who wakes up early, who stays up late, who sometimes doubts, sometimes fears, but never stops ‚Äî this is your moment. The JEE journey is tough, but so are you.
        <br><br>
        There will be moments when the syllabus seems never-ending, when mock scores make you question yourself, when others may seem ahead. But know this ‚Äî every step, every effort, every minute you spend studying brings you closer to your goal.
        <br><br>
        Be inspired by the greats, but remember: your story is still being written. Stay disciplined, stay focused, and stay kind to yourself. Because one day, you‚Äôll look back at these tough days and say ‚Äî ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt give up.‚Äù And that‚Äôs what will make you unstoppable.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Believe in yourself. You are not alone. EduPortal is with you ‚Äî every step of the way. üöÄ</strong>
